In this exercise you will look at the [Umbraco Content Delivery API](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/reference/content-delivery-api) integrated directly into your Astro project using JavaScript `fetch` requests.

This is a quick exercise to simply **observe** a direct Content Delivery API integration via a simple `fetch` request.

This has been preconfigured for you in the example file `fetch-example.astro` in the `/blog` directory.

_Note: There is no code to implement in this exercise._

### Open the Fetch Example File

Open `blog/fetch-example.astro` in your editor:

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Code/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ blog/
                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fetch-example.astro ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
```

This fetches the blog article pages from Umbraco and acts as a listing page.

- Observe how simple it is to set up direct API calls in Astro.

- Think about the limitations of this direct-fetch approach - we will next implement a more robust approach.

### Run the Fetch Example

Make sure the backend CMS is running

```powershell title=".Code/Backend/DeveloperBlog.Umbraco/"
dotnet run
```

Run the Astro project (make sure the Umbraco project is also running).

```
npm run dev
```

Now browse to: [http://localhost:4321/blog/fetch-example](http://localhost:4321/blog/fetch-example)

Note: This file is for demonstration purposes and can be deleted for your actual blog.
