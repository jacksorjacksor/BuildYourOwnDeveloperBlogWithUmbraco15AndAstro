We will next be generating our TypeScript definitions.

Think of this as Umbraco Models Builder, but for TypeScript

### Orval

[Orval](https://orval.dev/) a RESTful client generator, and in this repo is already set up for you.

In the future, you can refer to the [Orval documentaion](https://orval.dev/overview) for further exploration.

You can see the Orval configuration in the `orval.config.js` file (1️⃣).

Orval is called via an NPM script in the `package.json` file (2️⃣).

```
.
└── Code/
    └── Frontend/
        ├── orval.config.js 1️⃣
        └── package.json 2️⃣
```

The command you need to run the NPM script which generates the TypeScript definitions is:

```bash title = "Code/Frontend"
npm run umb-ts-generate
``` 

Ensure Umbraco is running before executing.

Once run, this will generate TypeScript Types and Services in `src/umbraco-client` (1️⃣)

The Types are located under `src/umbraco-client/model` (2️⃣)

An example of a generated type safe service can be found in `src/umbraco-client/content/content.ts` (3️⃣)

```
.
└── Code/
    └── Frontend/
        └── src/
            └── umbraco-client/ 1️⃣
                ├── content/
                │   └── content.ts 3️⃣
                └── model 2️⃣
```

🤯 Imagine writing all that by hand!

This approach is genuinely a game changer when working headlessly with Umbraco.
