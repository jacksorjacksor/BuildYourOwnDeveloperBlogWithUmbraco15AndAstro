We will next be generating our TypeScript definitions.

Think of this as Umbraco Models Builder, but for TypeScript

### Orval

[Orval](https://orval.dev/) a RESTful client generator, and in this repo is already set up for you.

In the future, you can refer to the [Orval documentaion](https://orval.dev/overview) for further exploration.

You can see the Orval configuration in the `orval.config.js` 1Ô∏è‚É£ file.

Orval is called via an NPM script in the `package.json` 2Ô∏è‚É£ file.

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Code/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orval.config.js 1Ô∏è‚É£
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json 2Ô∏è‚É£
```

The command you need to run the NPM script which generates the TypeScript definitions is:

```bash title = "Code/Frontend"
npm run umb-ts-generate
```

Ensure Umbraco is running before executing.

Once run, this will generate TypeScript Types and Services in `src/umbraco-client`

The Types are located under `src/umbraco-client/model`

An example of a generated type safe service can be found in `src/umbraco-client/content/content.ts` ‚≠ê

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Code/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ umbraco-client/
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/
                ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ content.ts ‚≠ê
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model
```

ü§Ø Imagine writing all that by hand!

This approach is genuinely a game changer when working headlessly with Umbraco.
