# Build Your Own Developer Blog with Umbraco 15 & Astro

## Workshop date

Tuesday 17th June 2025

## Proposal

> Join Umbraco MVPs Richard Jackson and Adam Prendergast for a hands-on workshop where you’ll create a fully functional developer blog using Umbraco 15’s Content Delivery API and the popular static site generator, Astro.
> 
> We’ll be using the Delivery API Extensions package for generating strongly typed classes and mapping those classes to Typescript with OpenAPI TypeScript. We’ll also be using the Contentment's code editor along with PrismJS to provide code snippet highlighting. We’ll then be looking to generate and deploy our site onto hosting platforms such as Vercel automatically through Umbraco’s native webhook integrations. As a little bonus, we can add RSS support and request to be added to the Umbraco Community Blogs list!
> 
> Whether you’re a solo developer or part of a larger team, this workshop will give you practical, real-world experience in building and deploying a modern developer blog - leaving you with a live site and all the know-how to keep it growing.
