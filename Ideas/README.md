# Ideas

Break it up into clear sections, for example:

- Welcome & Intro  
  --- What is Astro  
  --- What is the Content Delivery API

- Workshop Sections (to be defined)  
  --- …  
  --- Contentment Code → PrismJS

- Deploying  
- Wrap-up  
- Onwards Activities (could there be some optional extras for those who want to stick around after the 2 hours – if allowed)

---

## How might we present the concepts?

- Short, bite-sized talks  
- Show by doing (though maybe steer clear of live demos as they can slow things down)

---

## How can we help people get hands-on and productive within a short 2-hour window?

- Start with an initial branch that offers a semi-scaffolded setup  
- Include parts with placeholder areas to be filled in  
- Provide code snippets to support those who need a hand (so they’re not having to type everything from scratch)

# Codebase Ideas

Let’s build up a solid, working codebase of the final project (I’ve got a few Astro projects I can borrow from and strip out the 'faff', so we end up with a clean, streamlined solution).

We can create branches at key checkpoints during the workshop. That way, if anyone falls behind, they can easily catch up. They’re also handy for seeing what’s changed between stages via diffs.

# Random Ideas

CodeGarden asked, *"Is there anything unusual we can help you with?"*  
- Maybe we could offer a takeaway merch item (sticker / badge?)  
- Something fun like:  
  *"I made a Developer Blog in 2 hours with Rich & Adam"*  
  *"I Dev Blog"*
